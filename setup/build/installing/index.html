<h1 id="installing-loop">Installing Loop<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-loop" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h1>
<p>The overall installation process is pretty simple.  Loop is written in code that is stored online; available for us to download for free.  In order to compile all that code into a useable app on your iPhone, we need to use a free Apple program called Xcode.  Xcode takes all that code &amp; makes an app...but Apple is particular about apps and installation on devices.  So, in order to put this app on our iPhones, we have to enroll in Apple's Developer Program.  Once you enroll as a developer, you will be able to "sign" the Loop app in Xcode so that it will properly install onto your iPhone.</p>
<p>While all of this is straight forward...I'll tell you some hints upfront to save time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your watchOS, iPhone OS, macOS first to see if they need updates.  Currently you'll need at least watchOS 4, iOS 10.3.3 (or iOS 11 if you are using an Apple watch) , macOS 10.12.6</li>
<li>Downloading Xcode 9 can take 20-45 minutes depending on your internet connection speed.  You can do that ahead of time if you want to save yourself some waiting when you're ready to build.</li>
<li>Apple watches need to be paired with the iPhone BEFORE the Loop app is built onto the phone in order to have the Loop on the watch, too.  If you pair a new Apple watch later, you'll have to rebuild the Loop app onto the iPhone again, before the watch will work with Loop functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setup-your-apple-computer">Setup your Apple Computer<a class="headerlink" href="#setup-your-apple-computer" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<h3 id="verify-macos">Verify macOS<a class="headerlink" href="#verify-macos" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h3>
<p>You need to be running macOS Sierra, at least version 10.12.6, so verify by clicking the apple logo in your computer display's upper left corner and selecting "About this Mac"</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/macosx.png" width="450">
</p>

<p>If your macOS is not Sierra, click on the <code>Software Update</code> button and update to Sierra.  If your computer is older than late 2009, you may not be able to update to Sierra.  You can check Sierra compatibility <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/how-to-upgrade/#hardware-requirements">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="install-homebrew-and-carthage">Install Homebrew and Carthage<a class="headerlink" href="#install-homebrew-and-carthage" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h3>
<p>Open the Terminal application on your computer.  It is located in the Applications folder, and then look in the Utilities subfolder for the Terminal application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy and paste the line below into Terminal prompt.  Press return after you paste it in.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</code></p>
<ul>
<li>There will be a prompt asking if you want to continue.  Press return to continue, then it may prompt for your password.  Enter your computer user password (don't worry, Terminal app doesn't show keystrokes when you enter passwords, but it is still reading your typing).  Wait while the script does its thing...you’ll see info scroll by and then it will pause for awhile.  Eventually, it will be done and you’ll see something that says “Installation successful” and you’ll have a ready Terminal prompt again.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/carthage.jpg" width="450">
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Type <code>brew update</code> and press return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type <code>brew install carthage</code> and press return.  You can confirm carthage has been installed by running <code>carthage version</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can close the Terminal application now.  You’re done with it.  You do not need to do these steps again for any subsequent Loop builds.</p>
<h2 id="setup-your-apple-developer-account">Setup your Apple Developer Account<a class="headerlink" href="#setup-your-apple-developer-account" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<p>In order to build your own copy of the Loop app onto your iPhone, you will need an Apple developer account.  You will have two options for your individual account; free or paid.</p>
<p>If you decide to enroll in a <strong>FREE</strong> developer account, here's what you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Loop apps signed with a free developer team will expire after 7 days.  On the 7th day, your Loop app will simply turn white when you open it and then immediately close.  To rebuild the Loop app, you will have to find a computer and rebuild the app onto your iPhone again.  You cannot rebuild the app on day 5 (when it is convenient, for example)...hoping to reset the 7-day clock.  The app will still expire on the 7th day from when it was first signed and created.</br></br></li>
<li>If you decide to switch to a paid account after trying out the free account, you will need to rebuild your Loop app with a new main app bundle identifier (this will make sense when you go through the rest of these instructions...just make a mental note for now) and sign with the new team name.</li>
</ol>
<p>To activate enrollment in a free developer account, you simply need to add your Apple ID to the Xcode application's Preferences in the Accounts tab, as outlined in the Xcode section below.  (Note: The Apple ID you use to sign up for the developer account does not need to be the same Apple ID as the Looping iPhone uses, for example parent's installing Loop on kid's iPhone.  Typically for the developer account, use the Apple ID of the person who will be doing the Loop app building.)  You don't have to specifically go into the Apple Developer Program website to enroll...Xcode automatically amends your Apple ID to include the free developer signing.  Once you add your Apple ID, you will see a team name listed, like the screenshot below, with a <code>(personal team)</code> designation to indicate that is a free developer team.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/free-enroll.png" width="650">
</p>

<p>If you decide to enroll in a <strong>PAID</strong> developer account, here's what you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Loop apps signed with a paid developer team will last for a full year.</br></br></li>
<li>The paid developer account is $99 per year and is default set to auto-renew annually.  You can change that selection in your developer account settings at any time.</br></br></li>
</ol>
<p>To activate a paid account, go to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/">Apple Developer website</a> to sign-up for your individual account.  (Note: The Apple ID you use to sign up for the developer account does not need to be the same Apple ID as the Looping iPhone uses, for example parent's installing Loop on kid's iPhone.  Typically for the developer account, use the Apple ID of the person who will be doing the Loop app building.)   After you enroll, make sure you look for a confirmation email.  Apple says it can take up to 24 hours to confirm and setup a new Apple developer account, however some people have had the process only take minutes.  It can vary.</p>
<p>Periodically, Apple will update the license agreement for the Developer Program.  When that happens, you'll need to login to your developer account and accept the new license agreement before you can sign a new/updated Loop app again.</p>
<h2 id="setup-xcode">Setup Xcode<a class="headerlink" href="#setup-xcode" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<p>Open the App Store application on your computer.  Search for Xcode and click on the link to download/install Xcode for free.  The file size is fairly large so expect about 20-45 minutes to download depending on your internet speed.  You will need Xcode 9 at least to build the current Loop app.  If you have a previous installation of Xcode, please make sure to check for updates first, before building Loop.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/xcode.jpg" width="450">
</p>

<p>Once you have Xcode downloaded, open it from your Applications folder.  There may be a short delay as Xcode installs new command lines that the app uses.  Once Xcode is open and ready, we will start with adding your new developer account to Xcode.</p>
<p>Go to the Xcode main menu (top left of your screen) and select Preferences from the Xcode dropdown menu.  Then, click on the “Accounts” tab in the Preferences window and then press the <code>+</code> in the lower left corner to add an Apple ID account.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/xcode_account.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>If you are establishing a free developer account, you will simply enter your Apple ID in this section and Xcode will automatically create your free developer account. If you enrolled in the paid account, enter the Apple ID of the paid developer account.  If you never enrolled in the free account, you will not have a (personal team) showing.  The screenshot is what will appear if you have used both types of enrollment under the same Apple ID.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/apple_id.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>Finally, we are going to turn on Line Numbers to make some later steps in the build process easier.  Go to the "Text Editing" tab in the top of the Preferences window.  Click the box to show Line Numbers.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/text_lines.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>You are now done setting up your Xcode environment.  Great job!  You will not need to redo the account setup steps on any subsequent builds or updates of your Loop app.  Xcode will remember these settings.</p>
<h2 id="download-loop-source-code">Download Loop Source Code<a class="headerlink" href="#download-loop-source-code" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<p>Next, you’ll need to obtain the Loop’s source code in order to build the app on your computer.  If you click on the link below, a copy of the Loop source code’s master branch will be downloaded to your Downloads folder.
</br></br>
<p align="center">
<a href="https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop/archive/master.zip">Loop: Master branch source code</a>
</p></br>
FYI: The Loop source code resides in <a href="https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop">GitHub</a> within a repository.  A repository is kind of like a project's bookshelf, holding various books (aka branches) of a project.  The master branch is considered a stable version.  Any new features or options are first tested in a dev (short for "development") branch of the Loop.  New or inexperienced users should not build from the dev branch of Loop.  So if you hear of "new features in dev", these are things that may be eventually merged into the master branch once any bugs are worked out.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p>IMPORTANT NOTES: Best practice is to leave your Loop source code in your Downloads folder.  If you store your Loop code a different folder than Downloads (such as your Documents folder or Desktop), make sure the specified folder is <strong>not</strong> an iCloud drive.  Storing your Loop code in an iCloud drive folder will prevent Loop from building successfully.  How do you know if a folder is an iCloud drive?  Check your System Preferences.  If your System Preferences for iCloud is set as shown below, your Documents and Desktop folders are iCloud drives and <strong>NOT</strong> appropriate places to save your Loop download.
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/icloud-drive.png" width="650">
</p></br>
Depending on your browser and settings, your Loop download may or may not automatically unzip.  If it does not unzip automatically, you can right-click on the zip file and choose to "Open With" Archive Utility.  This will create a blue folder called <code>Loop-master</code>.  HOWEVER, if you already have an existing <code>Loop-master</code> folder from a previous download, the name of the next download will be something like <code>Loop-master (1)</code>.  The problem with that folder name is that it contains a space...and spaces in the name will cause your Loop build to fail.  So, either delete old copies of Loop before downloading/unzipping or rename the folder(s) to ensure that NO SPACES are in the folder name.
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/folder-name.png" width="650">
</p></p>
</div>
<p>Advanced method: Alternatively, if you are already familiar with git and Terminal app use, you could save a local copy of Loop source code to your computer using <code>git clone https://github.com/LoopKit/Loop.git</code>.  This method would allow for saving local changes and updating, but does require some familiarity with git commands.  For new users, or those unfamiliar with git, we recommend using the direct download of master branch, above.  Loop is easily rebuilt and doesn't need to be saved locally long-term.</p>
<h2 id="installing-loop-using-xcode">Installing Loop using Xcode<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-loop-using-xcode" title="Permanent link">⌁</a></h2>
<p>Here’s where the fun really begins.  You’re about to build your Loop app.</p>
<p>Go to your Downloads folder, open the <code>Loop-master</code> folder (or whatever you named it...double check that the folder does not contain any spaces in the folder name, as described above), and double click on Loop.xcodeproj.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/loop_code.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>A warning may appear asking if you really want to open it, click Open.  Xcode will get itself organized and installed, this may take a few minutes.  The first time you load Xcode you may also be asked about allowing keychain access (yes, always).  Xcode will eventually open the Loop project...the first open of Xcode just takes a little longer than subsequent uses.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/loop_open.jpg" width="450">
</p>

<p>Once Xcode has finished indexing, the Loop project's various folders and files will appear in the far left column.  Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the list and then click on the file called Loop.xcconfig.  The middle portion of Xcode window will populate and this is where you will find the MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER. The default is com.loopkit</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/main_app_id.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>You need to change the MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER  to your own unique identifier.  Keep it in the reverse-domain syntax, meaning start with <code>com.</code> and without any extensions after your chosen identifier.  The example below uses <code>dynamicloop</code> to replace the default <code>loopkit</code>...you choose your own phrase/name without spaces or periods.   If some other Looper has already used the same phrase, you will get a build error later in this build process...so make your name somehow slightly personal to you.   Hint: you can't use <code>com.dynamicloop</code> or <code>com.loopkit</code> or <code>com.loudnate</code> for example because other Loopers have already used them. <strong><u>After you enter your new MAIN_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER, save the project using Command-S</u></strong></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/your_id.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>After saving the project, scroll back up to the top of the file list in the left-hand column.  At the very top, click on the blue Loop main project folder.  Then click on the box in the middle screen to reveal the targets' column.  The four targets we will sign in the upcoming steps are now easily viewable.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/target_view.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>Connect your iPhone via cable to the computer, select your iPhone from the very top of the drop down list.  Your <strong><u>iPhone’s personal name</u></strong> should be at the top of the list.  Don't accidentally select the generic iOS simulators listed below your iPhone's name.  If your iPhone has a lock enabled, it may be helpful to temporarily disable the lock until you finish building Loop app.  Xcode has a hard time building to locked iPhones.  You can reset your lock once Loop is done building onto the phone.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/select_device.png" width="750">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/your_device.png" width="750">
</p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p>These next steps are usually only needed on the first Loop build; they can be skipped on subsequent builds.</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is the first time your iPhone has been plugged in to this computer, you will need to open the iPhone and select "Trust this Computer" before your device will be useable in the menu selection.</br></br></li>
<li>If this is the first time you are building an app onto this iPhone using this particular Apple developer account, you will need to “register the device” to your developer account.  The device registration screen, as shown below, should automatically appear when your iPhone is selected.
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/device1.png" width="450">

<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/device3.png" width="450">
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Once you select your device (iPhone), let's start signing our four targets.  We will start with the Loop target, the first one on the target list.  Under the "Signing" area, select the dropdown menu where it currently says "none".  Choose your team that you'd like to sign with.  If you select a team name with (personal team), your app will expire after 7 days.  If you select a team name without that (personal team), your app will last a full year.  If you never signed up for a free developer account, you will not have a (personal team) showing.  Make sure you keep the "automatically manage signing" box checked above the team selection area.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/select_team.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>Once you choose your signing team, Xcode will automatically generate provisioning profiles and signing certificates.  If this is the first time you are building on this iPhone with this developer account, you may again be prompted to register the device.  Simply click on the "Register Device" button to confirm.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/register_device.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>A successfully signed target will have a provisioning profile and signing certificate similar to the screenshot below.  Click on each of the three remaining targets, and repeat the signing steps by choosing the same team name as you selected in the first target.</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/success.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>If instead, you saw an error message like below then you will need to make a correction.  Remember how we said you needed to make a unique name in the previous steps?  You have either (1) failed to use a unique-to-you main app bundle ID or (2) failed to save the project after changing the main app bundle ID earlier.  Go back to the starting steps in building the Loop app, in the Loop.xcconfig file where you changed <code>com.loopkit</code>.  Pick a new main app bundle ID and press command-s to save the project.  Then return to re-sign the targets with the updated info.</p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Do you want customizations before you finish building?</p>
<p><strong>New Loop users</strong>: Customizations are not a required part of any Loop build.  As you gain experience in how you use your Loop app, you may want to customize some of the features.  You can always update your Loop app to add customizations at a later time.  Really though, building with the standard, default installation is JUST FINE.</br></br>
If you want any custom configurations to your Loop or Watch apps, now is the time to make them before you finish with the last step of Loop installation on your iPhone.  Follow the step-by-step instructions on the <a href="../code_customization/">Code Customizations</a> page.  When you’ve completed those customizations, please return here and follow the next steps to finish the installation of Loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Have you paired your Apple Watch already?</p>
<p><strong>New Apple Watch users</strong>: If you have an unopened Apple watch and want to use it with Loop, first pair the watch with the iPhone before continuing to the next steps.  If you get a new watch after building the Loop app, you'll need to redo your Loop build. (Don't worry, it's as easy as pressing play on your saved Loop project.)</br></br>
<strong>Existing Apple Watch users</strong>: Please update your watchOS prior to building Loop app.  The current version of Loop (v1.5) requires watchOS 4.</p>
</div>
<p>All done with any customizations? Have your Apple watch paired and updated?  Let’s finish the installation of the Loop app onto your iPhone.  Double check to make sure your iPhone's name is still selected and then press the “play” button (or build button) to start Xcode on its way.  You’ll see the progression of the build in the status window.  If the build is successful, you'll see a brief pop-up graphic saying "Build succeeded" and then it will say "running Loop" in the status bar. (Troubleshooting tips for common build errors are below, too...scroll down)</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/build_button.png" width="750">
</p>

<p>If this is the first time you have installed an app on your iPhone using your Developer Account, you may get a warning like this.  Just follow the directions in the warning for what you need to do in your iPhone settings, and the issue resolves very quickly.  Click ok and you can safely disconnect your iPhone from the computer.  (If you don’t get a warning and the Loop app installs but does not open, you may still need to go to Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Device Management and enable trust for your Developer Account.)</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/trust_device.jpg" width="750">
</p>

<p>You can confirm Loop has installed on your phone simply by looking on the iPhone.  Turn it on and check if the Loop app is running.  Brand new Loop apps will usually have a screen open immediately asking about allowing Loop notifications and Health App access.  Updated Loop apps won't usually show any special screen after a successful build.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">CONGRATS!  YOU JUST INSTALLED LOOP!</p>
